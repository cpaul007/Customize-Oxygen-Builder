# Customize Oxygen Builder
A helper plugin to customize the Oxygen Builder site. Originally Oxygen Builder is not using the WP Themes. Therefore you can't use the functions.php file and add the custom PHP codes. Inside the builder has the **CODE BLOCK** elements and write the PHP code, but sometimes it will not be suitable option (when you are adding the bunch of codes, customizing the plugin's templates etc).

### assets 
- This folder will contain the CSS and JS files which will use on the site

### elements 
- You will put the custom elements folders to inside this folder

### includes
- There have a **helpers.php file**. You would write your all custom codes inside that file

# Installation

* Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress admin. Click on Upload Plugin and browse for the zip file.
* Activate the plugin.

# FAQs

### How shall I edit the files?

You can use the FTP/SFTP or CPanel -> File Manager tools. You can also use the **WP File Manager plugin**. Therefore you can directly add/edit/delete the files and folders from your Dashboard. Keep in mind that you would delete this plugin after completing your work.
